					<description><![CDATA[Mbira DzaVadzimu does not only refer to the instrument but also the sound that comes from the instrument. The gwarivare is tuned in a particular way to produce that rhythm that play songs that invoke the ancestral spirits at a bira function. The common tuning for this being the Nyamaropa tuning if the mudzimu is ‘old’ (vakuru vepasichigare).Most of the mbira songs played today are generally for listening pleasure hence they are tuned in a way that produce sounds almost like electric guitars, and that’s no use for traditional ancestral biras. Most gwenyambiras from Mhondoro area still play this tune (e.g. Mhuri yekwaRwizi, Magaya etc). Please note that tuning requirements and tempo can also slightly vary from dunhu to dunhu but the generality is the same. There are so many tunings available today that are not playable at biras, but good for studio recordings and live shows.]]></description>
