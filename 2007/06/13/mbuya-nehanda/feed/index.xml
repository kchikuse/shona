					<description><![CDATA[ah i laughed a lot an article which is meant to preserve people history must at least respect facts if it loses fact it makes the whole credibility at stake.In this article the author state that Nehanda rose to fame right about 1896 which i agree , but i don’t agree with a blatant lie that King Lobhengula recognized Nehanda.Lobhengula fled into Zambia in 1893 and died among Zwangendaba / Angoni in 1894 he did not live to see 1896 , please chech historical facts well before your worlk losses credibility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No need for ‘The Bones of Nehanda’ to concern themselves about the so-called ‘god’ (or ‘allah’) of the criminal invaders to African ancestral space.The Western word/concept “god” is merely a figment of ignorant and overworked imagination! There is absolutely no reality to that foreign word/concept ‘god’! It is a throwaway word, a garbage word. And that is why the vast majority of euros do not bother with ‘god’ and the rest of the christian crap: The euros may be evil and beastly in their historically destructive behavior; but they aren’t all unintelligent, at least not superficially unintelligent.Trying to find out what ‘god’ equates with in Shona or African culture, is like trying to find out what the nonsense word ‘vreeacmaicaticl’ equates with. It equates WITH NOTHING of value.The words/concepts ‘god’ and ‘allah’ are merely part of the the FOREIGN, mind-wasting and mind-weakening religious rubbish of criminal invaders.The aim is to deceive unawake Africans into thinking and believing that somehow those foreign nonsense words/concepts (‘god’, ‘allah’) have relevance and resonance in African culture, and are somehow superior to the real Beings of African culture. They DO NOT! Its all nonsense &amp; LIES, part of the ‘successful brainwashing of SOME Africans, but not all!Many Africans know the truth about the LIES of the criminal invaders of Africans; and in time &amp; with even a little contemplation, others will also come to know that the ideological insanity imposed on Africans, are really meant to brainwash Africans in being mental slaves to criminal invaders. It’s time to liberate the mind from the mental enslavement to foreign rubbish.The ‘essential nature’ of the African IS eternal! No person really dies; only bodies die.Therefore the ancestors continue to exist as ‘beings without gross physical bodies’. Nehanda knew this fact, represented this truth, and lived this truth.That is why the wise Nehanda could have stated with confidence that her “bones will rise again”, and so ensure the successful Chimurenga against the pale plague that invaded from Europe.Those who invested lives, limbs, labor, blood, sweat &amp; tears to ensure the successful Chimurenga are ‘The Bones of Nehanda’! And Nehanda lives on with the wise ancestors, as a ‘beings without gross physical bodies’. Some Africans need to become awake again to these eternal truth about human eternal existence, which were well documented by the African ancestors of Nile Valley Civilizations for many thousands of years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So from reading this interesting article I have to wonder then…when did ‘mwari’ translate to being ‘God’ (from the christian perspective)? If Kaguvi and NeHanda were voices of ‘mwari’ and also incarnations of spirit mediums of the 1430′s…how then did mwari and God mean the same thing? I respect christianity was even baptised but when i start going through our history of Zimbabwe and other once colonized nations I begin to wonder how christianity could have been a good thing for us considering it was the missionaries that paved the way for colonizers…and its very suspect too how mwari was then translated to mean God when clearly they meant different things. I wonder how different Zimbabwe would have been if we had held fast to our original version of ‘mwari’]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this contribution. Your contribution has prompted me to do further research into the element of incest in Zimbabwean culture. I do not remember well where I heard or read about the practice of incest especially amongst people with the totem Mwoyo Chirandu, I am one myself. It is said that incest was used by appointed Chiranhu Chiefs as a means of increasing powers. It is understood that a newly appointed Chief of the Mwoyo Chirandu totem had to go through the incest ritual and this eventually resulted in the expulsion of the Chirandus from Great Zimbabwe (I think). I am not quite aware of the actual facts but I will work on my research. Are there any Chirandu Chiefs who are still practising such rituals?? Of course it would be discreet given modern day laws regarding incest.]]></description>
