We were religous so they used that to sort of claim that the God they were preaching to us is the same as our Mwari, then after that they changed the game everything about christianity was different from our initial beliefs. They managed to convince everyone by saying Jesus christ came to change the old ways to new ways....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does this mean therefore Shona believed in Mwari before the Whites brought the bible and started praising Jesus instead ?
