					<description><![CDATA[Yes, i believe there is a great connection of Mwari   of our Ancestors and the Christian God really especially when we want to look at this controversial issue of inculturation and some others values we are losing ..........really  I conquer with some few individuals who still want to publicly practice African religion with great respect and honor.... Of course in this perverse generation of ours we may nor want to believe it but they are still good signs of the present of Mwari of our Ancestors in our African culture.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is very interesting especially regarding the lessening influence of Mwari after independence.  Could it be then that&#039;s the cause of most of the challenges the country is going through.  If the belief in Mwari and our culture enabled us Africans to win the war of independence why have turned our back to our own.  Now we have embraced Christianity and its prophets etc, look where we are now.  We may not want it to believe it but I see a connection here.  We betrayed Mwari and he turned his back on us.  And the Christian God must be happy and rejoicing.]]></description>
